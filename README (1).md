# Task 2 - Data Visualization & Storytelling

Dataset: Superstore Sample (cleaned)  
Author: Your Name  

## Steps I did:
1. Cleaned dataset and created derived columns (`Year`, `MonthYear`, `ProfitMargin`).
2. Designed a storyboard with KPIs, trends, category analysis, discounts vs profit, and customer segments.
3. Built an interactive dashboard in Tableau/Power BI (not included here, add `.pbix` or `.twbx` file if you created).
4. Exported results to PDF/screenshots.

## Key Insights:
- Technology segment has highest sales but Office Supplies dominates in volume.  
- Discounts beyond 20% often lead to losses.  
- West region performs best, while South struggles with profitability.  

## Files included:
- `superstore_clean.csv` → Cleaned dataset ready for Tableau/Power BI  
- `superstore_sample.csv` → Raw generated dataset  
- `data_prep.py` → Python script to generate & clean dataset  
- `README.md` → Project explanation  

## How to view:
- Open `superstore_clean.csv` in Tableau or Power BI.  
- Reproduce visuals as per storyboard (KPIs, trend, category, scatter, map, etc).
